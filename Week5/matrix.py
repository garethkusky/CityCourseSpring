#Display matrix of 0s and 1s
#Write a function that displays an n­by­n matrix using the following header:
#def printMatrix(n):
#Each element is 0 or 1, which is generated randomly. Write a test program that
#prompts the user to enter n and displays an n­by­n matrix. Here is a sample run:
#Entern:3
#010
#000
#111

def printMatrix(n):
    i=0
    for i in range (n):
        for i in range (n):
