#Following the example of the Circle class seen in the course, design a class named Rectangle
#to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
# Two data fields named width and height.
# A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height.
# The default values are 1 and 2 for the width and height, respectively.
# A method named getArea()that returns the area of this rectangle.
# A method named getPerimeter()that returns the perimeter.
# Draw the UML diagram for the class, and then implement the class. Write a test program that
# creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 and height 40 and the other with width 3.5 and
# height 35.7. Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order
